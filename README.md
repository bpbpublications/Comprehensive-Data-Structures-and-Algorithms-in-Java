## About the Book
Data Structures and Algorithms is an important subject in any university curriculum for computer science stream. It provides a great tool in the hands of software engineers and plays significant role in software design and development. It is also becoming a must have skill for many competitions and job interviews in software industry.

This book covers the topics useful for students and also for software developers working in industry. The concepts are explained in step-wise manner and illustrated with numerous figures, text, examples and immediate code samples which helps in better understanding of data structures and algorithms with their implementation. There are exercises at the end of the chapters which helps students to explore more and build better foundation of subject. The book has more than 500 illustrations, code samples and problems. Solutions for exercises are also available with programs. Students can use it for self-learning and developers can use this for providing efficient solutions for their day-to-day development problems.

After completion of this book, students will have good understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms concepts and implementation. Software engineers will be able to provide better solutions with appropriate data structures and efficient algorithms.
